# Fixes
* Add action for form deletion
* Add action for form duplication from the Translation Dashboard. The duplicate is then available as a translation of the form that can be edited with the Translation Editor
* Add actions for updating forms and form settings (confirmations and notifications). Changed original content (e.g. field labels) appears immediately in the Translation Editor with 'translation is finished' unchecked. Addition and deletion of fields is also handled correctly, without having to delete the translation job and resubmit a new one
* Add filter to translate error messages
* Add our own filters 'gform_multilingual_form_keys' and 'gform_multilingual_field_keys' so that plugin authors can register additional keys for translation
* Add readme.txt
* Display warning when WPML or Gravity Forms are inactive and do not load plugin
* For choice fields (dropdowns, etc), translate the option label, not the actual value (needed for conditional logic to work)
* gform_pre_render now takes two arguments, and handles confirmations differently
* Gravity forms appear in Translation Dashboard with the 'Any' filter
* Merge tags work correctly with translations
* Remove gform_confirmation filter, as it works in a different way in GF 1.7
* Translate multiple confirmations. Confirmations are translated for messages and for page and url redirections
* Translate multiple notifications (emails). They are translated when then email To field is entered by the user, and sent to the user in the languageinwhich the form was submitted
* Translate multiselect values, also in merge tags
* Translate page titles in multipage forms
* Translate previous, next and last button texts (and button imageUrls) in multipage forms
* Translate price labels for products/options
* Translation status is correctly reflected in the Translation Dashboard and the Translation Queue
